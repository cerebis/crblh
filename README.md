#CRBLH

##Protein homology groups by clustered reciprocal best LAST hit.

CRBLH is a python tool for prediction homology (ortholog) groups from all-vs-all LAST searches.

The initial set of associations generated by LAST are used to construct a graph, where nodes are protein sequences and edges are LAST hits. The graph is then pruned to only reciprocal associations.

Here, the disconnected components of the graph can then taken as predicted homology groups or optionally, these components can be further decomposed by application of the Louvain method, where a "best partitioning" of the graph is used to predict communities of tightly inter-associated sub-graphs. This decomposition is iteratively applied, until a user specified modularity threshold is reached. The set of decomposed sub-graphs are then taken as the predicted homology groups.
